# WORDLE

[WORDLE](https://www.powerlanguage.co.uk/wordle/) is a daily word game developed by Josh Wardle, a programmer from Brooklyn [(wikipedia entry)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wordle_(video_game)). The New York Times has called it a ["Love Story"](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/03/technology/wordle-word-game-creator.html). Guess the WORDLE in 6 tries. The goal is to guess the WORDLE in 6 tries. After each guess, the color of the tiles change to show how close our guess is to the WORDLE.

# This project

In this project, we develop an algorithm that optimises our guess through the simple set of rules layed out by the game itself.
